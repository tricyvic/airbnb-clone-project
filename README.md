# airbnb-clone-project
## Project Description
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## UI/UX Design Planning
- Document design goals and key features
- Create page descriptions for main views
- Analyze Figma design specifications
- Identify color schemes and typography
